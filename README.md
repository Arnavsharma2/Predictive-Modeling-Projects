# Predictive Modeling Projects

Portfolio of machine learning projects using various predictive modeling techniques including Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and deep learning models.

## What It Does

- **House Price Prediction**: Predicts house prices using regression models
- **Customer Churn Prediction**: Identifies customers likely to churn using classification
- **Stock Return Prediction**: Forecasts stock returns using time series and deep learning
- **Blackjack Analysis**: Analyzes optimal betting strategies using simulation and ML

Controls:
- Run individual project notebooks or Python scripts
- Each project has its own dataset and model files

## How It Works

1. **Data Loading**: Loads datasets from project-specific folders
2. **Feature Engineering**: Prepares features for model training
3. **Model Training**: Trains models using scikit-learn, XGBoost, or TensorFlow/Keras
4. **Evaluation**: Calculates accuracy, R², or other relevant metrics
5. **Prediction**: Generates predictions on test data
